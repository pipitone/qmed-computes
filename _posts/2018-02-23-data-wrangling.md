In the [Data Wrangling
workshop](https://pipitone.github.io/qmed-computes/data-wrangling.html), I tried
something a little different: I interleaved portions of the [DataCamp lesson on
`dplyr`](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/dplyr-data-manipulation-r-tutorial)
with exercises of my own design that had learners redo their earlier work from
the [Spreadsheets](https://pipitone.github.io/qmed-computes/spreadsheets.html)
lesson using the vitals dataset, in R. 

The DataCamp lesson had short videos explaining a dplyr command, followed by a
few basic exercises. Learners then had the chance to apply the same concept to
the vitals dataset in RStudio, with a little less hand-holding. 

I thought this session worked really well. Learners seemed to like the DataCamp
videos (we watched the
[introduction](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/dplyr-data-manipulation-r-tutorial/chapter-two-select-and-mutate?ex=1)
together as a group), and liked the dplyr framework as a whole. 

I saw some eyes light up when we got to the section on pipes. With about 30
minutes to go, I switched teaching interactively. I quickly summarized the
commands up to `arrange()` and then explained piping as an alternative way to
string together dplyr commands.  I also then demod table joins aswell, because
I really wanted everyone to at least see that it was possible, and very easy. 

Takeaways: 
- Learners enjoyed the DataCamp video/drill + working with a dataset approach.
- 2 hours in not enough time. As per always. 
- I'd like to try more teaching interactively. Learners seem quite comfortable
  following online lessons, but I might try doing a quick (30 min) interactive
  lesson that covers a chunk of the important content (in this case, ggplot is
  up next) interactively, and then set the learners loose to work on their own. 
- ... Well, not on their own, I still encourage people to work in pairs. I could
  probably do a better job of encourage that. People seem to need push.
