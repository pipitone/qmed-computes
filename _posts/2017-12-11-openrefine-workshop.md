I ran the second QMED Computes workshop on December 6th, 2017. Topic: Cleaning up Messy Data with OpenRefine.

Attendees seemed to really love using OpenRefine -- it's easy to grok, and immediately clear how it will be useful.

For this workshop I had attendees follow the <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson">Data Carpentry lesson on OpenRefine</a>, but threw in a few other questions of my own.

Here's the workshop outline I provided:

Notes for next time:
<ul>
 	<li>Energy levels were good for the entire 2 hour session. I strongly suggested everyone get up after an hour and move around, which probably also helped.</li>
 	<li>I showed the GoogleRefine videos right off the bat. Attendees said that was a useful overview.</li>
 	<li>Most everyone was able to work through the tutorial on their own (or in pairs) with out much help from me.</li>
 	<li>I occasionally jumped in to demonstrate more advanced features (e.g. reconciling, or scripting) just show what is possible.</li>
 	<li>Most people did the discussion either on their own, or didn't get to it. I should explicitly make time for discussion questions, and tell everyone ahead of time I'll be doing that.</li>
</ul>
