## Big ideas
Here are the big takeaways I'd like you to leave with: 

- <span class="big-idea">Syntax is critical.</span>  
    A missing parenthesis, an extra comma... *You* can read past these things,
    but the machine will not. Be vigilant and precise.

- <span class="big-idea">When in doubt, read the docs. Or stackoverflow.</span>  
    Everything you write in a programming language has a precise meaning, and
    someone has often laboured to spell that out in the `help()`. If that
    fails, search [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com) because you
    aren't the first to run into this problem. 

- <span class="big-idea">Programming is a skill. Be patient, expect frustration.</span>  
    Exactly like learning a language, programming is a skill you develop with
    practice, but unlike learning a language, the world of programming changes
    quickly and constantly, so you will *always* be learning. 

## Learning objectives

Most important: 
- RStudio: what an IDE is, and why you would use it
- Major parts of an RStudio: file editor, console, memory display, inline help
- How the R console works: the read-eval-print-loop
- How to get help when learning R? 
- What variables a is, and how to tell what it contains
- Kinds of data: numbers, strings, vectors, lists, ...
- How to manipulate numbers, strings, vectors, lists
- Functions: how to call base functions, and functions from libraries
- Libraries: how to install them, load them, and get help on them

## Tasks

This workshop is a Choose Your Own Adventure. Depending on your experience, you
may want more or less hand-holding as you learn programming with R, and you may
want more or less interactivity. 

- Do [DataCamp](https://datacamp.com)'s [R
  Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).

  My opinion: This is good if you're a beginner, like to figure things out on
  your own, and like doing short, interactive, and independent exercises with
  instant feedback as you go.

  [DataCamp](https://datacamp.com) has also given us special access to their
  full set of online lessons for the next few months, so worth checking out to
  see if this learning format works for you. 

- Do [Software Carpentry's](https://software-carpentry.org) lesson on
  [Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/). 

  My opinion: This is good if you're a beginner, and want explanation of
  concepts and tasks as you go, and need to see a purpose behind what you're
  learning as you do it. These lessons try to give you an overview of the R
  programming language, so some sections may seem irrelevant if all you want to
  do is crunch numbers, but it's all useful stuff.

- Do [Data Carpentry's](https://datacarpentry.org) lesson [R for data anlysis
  and visualisation](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson)

  My opinion: This is good if you've have a little programming experience, or
  find yourself picking stuff up quickly. It is focused on *very* useful tools
  for analysis and visualization, and so doesn't cover some of the general
  features of R like the Software Carpentry workshop does. 

- Do [DataCamp's](https://datacamp.com) lessons [Intermediate
  R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r) or [Introduction to the
  TidyVerse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse)

  My opinion: You'll need to have some background in R and programming to dig
  into these lessons. 
  
## Resources 

- [Rstudio Online Learning](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/#R)
    
  A great starting place to learn R on your own. This page contains links to
  online tutorials, guides and software to help you learn R well. Recommend.

- [Good enough practices in scientific computing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5480810/)

   You may not think you are doing "scientific computing" but welcome to the
   21st century: you probably are. This paper outlines the basic strategies you
   should strive towards when you get going.
