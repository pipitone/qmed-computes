## Big ideas
Here are the big takeaways I'd like you to leave with: 

- <span class="big-idea">Syntax is critical.</span>  
    A missing parenthesis, an extra comma... *You* can read past these things,
    but the machine will not. Be vigilant and precise.

- <span class="big-idea">Programming is a skill, craft, and an art.</span>  

- <span class="big-idea">Be explicit. Talk to the duck.<span>  


## Learning objectives
- IDE
- variables
- kinds of data: numbers, strings, others

   You may not think you are doing "scientific computing" but welcome to the
   21st century: you probably are. This paper outlines the basic strategies you
