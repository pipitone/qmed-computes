<p>My name is Jon Pipitone. I'm second year medical student at Queen's
University, and the instructor for this course. I have a BSc and MSc in Computer
Science from the University of Toronto, and I have worked as a software
developer and research programmer for many years. I am also a volunteer
instructor with <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>
and <a href="https://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a> -- two organizations
that teach computing skills to researchers.</p>
